1. a way of solving problem by having a function calling itself
2. Write in 3 steps: 
    a. Execute same operation multiple times with different inputs
    b. Current input will smaller before inputs
    c. Base condition to terminate recursion 
3. Used in many algorithms (divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)

Recursion is save in stack memory
